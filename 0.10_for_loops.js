//named a string variable delicious
//used prebuilt property of name.length to get 9
//used lcv to start at 0  and loop
//put in the number we got, 9, to get stopping point
//CAN USE name.length to just do it all in one step
//this is used in data collection especially
//errors take up space. use as little memory as possible

//create animal variable and use a for loop to console.log each letter of name

	//conventional way to do lcv is as i
	//you can use emojis as variables in the code in swift
